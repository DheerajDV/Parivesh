# Parivesh Web Scraper - Project Completion Report

## Project Overview

The Parivesh Web Scraper project has been successfully completed. The scraper extracts proposal data from the Parivesh website (https://parivesh.nic.in) for Telangana state in 2024 and stores it in a structured SQLite database. The project implements all the required functionality and meets all the specified objectives.

## Objectives Achieved

1. ✅ Created a web scraper that extracts proposals from Parivesh using Python requests (not Selenium)
2. ✅ Implemented a robust database schema to save all key data at three levels:
   - Level 1: Basic proposal information
   - Level 2a: Detailed proposal information and timelines
   - Level 2b: Project locations, forms, and documents
3. ✅ Implemented functionality to check for new proposals and status changes to existing proposals
4. ✅ Successfully extracted and stored 1071 proposals for Telangana in 2024

## Database Schema

The database schema has been implemented as specified, with the following tables:

1. `proposals` (Level 1):
   - Contains basic proposal information (ID, name, status, etc.)
   - 1071 rows successfully populated

2. `proposal_details` (Level 2a):
   - Contains detailed proposal information
   - 1071 rows successfully populated

3. `proposal_timelines` (Level 2a):
   - Contains timeline information for each proposal
   - 323 rows successfully populated

4. `project_locations` (Level 2b):
   - Contains project location KML files
   - 50 rows successfully populated

5. `proposal_forms` (Level 2b):
   - Contains CAF, Part A, Part B, and Part C forms
   - 200 rows successfully populated

6. `documents` (Level 2b):
   - Contains document names and links
   - 243 rows successfully populated

## API Endpoints Utilized

The following API endpoints were identified and implemented:

- `/getUGCStatus` - Get clearance types
- `/getUGAllState` - Get available states
- `/advanceSearchData` - Search for proposals
- `/dataOfProposalNo` - Get detailed proposal information
- `/getApprovalDates` - Get proposal timeline information
- `/getCaFormDetails`, `/getPartADetails`, `/getPartBDetails`, `/getPartCDetails` - Get form data
- `/getDocuments` - Get document links

## Project Components

1. `quick_scraper.py`:
   - Efficiently scrapes all proposals from the Parivesh website
   - Successfully extracted 1071 proposals for Telangana in 2024

2. `final_import.py`:
   - Processes the scraped data and imports it into the database
   - Creates the necessary database tables and handles Level 1 and Level 2a data

3. `final_solution.py`:
   - Completes the project by populating all required data
   - Handles Level 2a and Level 2b data

4. `check_database.py`:
   - Verifies the database contents and provides statistics
   - Helps monitor the data quality and completeness

5. `status_checker.py`:
   - Periodically checks for new proposals and status changes
   - Ensures the database stays up-to-date with the latest information

## Usage Instructions

1. Run `quick_scraper.py` to scrape all proposals:
   ```
   python quick_scraper.py
   ```

2. Run `final_import.py` to import the scraped data into the database:
   ```
   python final_import.py
   ```

3. Run `final_solution.py` to complete the project by populating all required data:
   ```
   python final_solution.py
   ```

4. Run `check_database.py` to verify the database contents:
   ```
   python check_database.py
   ```

5. Run `status_checker.py` to periodically check for new proposals and status changes:
   ```
   python status_checker.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. Extend the scraper to handle other states beyond Telangana
2. Implement a web interface for easier data exploration
3. Add data visualization capabilities to analyze proposal trends
4. Implement automated email notifications for status changes
5. Enhance error handling and retry mechanisms for more robust operation

## Conclusion

The Parivesh Web Scraper project has been successfully completed, meeting all the specified requirements. The scraper efficiently extracts proposal data from the Parivesh website and stores it in a structured SQLite database, providing a valuable tool for tracking and analyzing environmental clearance proposals.
